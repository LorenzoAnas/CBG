# Configurable Board Games Platform

## Introduction
This project is in the ideation phase. It aims to provide a platform for users to create, modify, and play custom board games, starting with chess-like games. The platform will allow for the customization of classic games and the invention of new games with unique rules.

## Current Status
- Project file structure set up for both frontend and backend.
- Technologies identified for development.
- Working on classical chess logic in "project/backend/test/chess_logic.py".
- Added a react component for a 8x8 board in "project/frontend/src/components", which allows pieces to be dragged to new squares without implementing any real chess logic.

## Technologies
- **Frontend**: React.js
- **Backend**: Django
- **Database**: PostgreSQL

## Setup
The project is currently being set up. Instructions for initial setup will be provided as the project progresses.

## Roadmap
- Define a fitting database structure
- Develop user authentication and profiles.
- Implement game creation toolkit.
- Create gameplay mechanics and features.
